			<p>Apparently, I'm a "concrete sequential thinker." I honestly don't know if these thinking quizzes are based in real science or just a load of quackery, but I'm skeptical to say the least. Looking at all the different "<a class="hLink" href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">thinking styles</a>," I find their descriptions incredibly generalized and applicable to just about any person. I feel like I'm reading horoscopes, and in fact I feel that a quote regarding horoscopes from one of my favorite books could just as well apply to these "personality tests":

			<p><div class=code><code>A scientist places an ad in a Paris newspaper offering a free horoscope. He receives about 150 replies, each, as requested, detailing a place and time of birth. Every respondent is then sent the identical horoscope, along with a questionnaire asking how accurate the horoscope had been. Ninety-four per cent of the respondents (and 90 per cent of their families and friends) reply that they were at least recognizable in the horoscope. However, the horoscope was drawn up for a French serial killer. If an astrologer can get this far without even meeting his subjects, think how well someone sensitive to human nuances and not overly scrupulous might do.

			<p>Not that I believe there's any malicious intent here. But http://www.thelearningweb.net <i>does</i> have a big banner at the top advertising a book. So that's what I think about that. Someone please email me if you can present a credible study to back-up these thinking-style tests. The only critical analysis I could find regarding this subject matter was not kind. <a class="hLink" href="http://www.ukessays.com/essays/education/educational-theories-and-learning-styles-on-teaching-practice-education-essay.php">(1)</a> <a class="hLink" href="http://www.usaim.edu/usaimpublications/3247b5cd-full-thesis_final_v.2.pdf">(2)</a></p>

			<p>Moving on to the <a class="hLink" href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Fixed vs. Growth mindset</a>, this is something I can actually get on-board with. And hey, look! The site references a book <i>but</i> at the same time offers a link that makes it easy and obvious for people to find the book <i>for free</i> at a local library. How about that!

			<p>Anyways, I think I struggled with a fixed mindset through much of high school and for a good while after I graduated. As I grew up through elementary school, I was constantly being praised for being "so smart!" I now think that is the worst, most dangerous praise you can give to a young person. For me, it convinced me that was somehow inherently good at things, and when I wasn't, well I was already "so smart" that the hard thing must be impossible if I could not already do it. This was especially apparent with math subjects, which I received horrible grades for throughout my latter years of school. As it turns out, skills like math actually just take a lot of work! I'm sure some people have a better natural ability to work through math problems, but no one can just look at an equation for the first time in their life and instantly solve it. It takes work to understand concepts and theorems before reaching that point.</p>

			<p>Although I never woke up one morning and thought, "I should change to growth-based mindset," as I got older I did open my mind more to the possibility that I could eventually conquer any difficult problem with enough work and perseverance. I now never think of any problem being impossible to solve, or any skill being impossible to aquire. If I wanted to pick up a new instrument and learn it, I'm confident I could; it's only ever a matter of the amounts of time and dedication that I'm willing to put forth.</p>
