			Pair programming is a team of two people collaborating together while creating code, either while sitting next to each other or while video conferencing. Typically, it is best accomplished by having one person act as the "navigator" and the other as the "driver." Much like a navigator in the passenger's seat of a card, the navigator's role in pair programming is to guide the driver on where to take the code. Just as a driver doesn't need to be constantly reminded, "to turn that corner you're going to need to turn the steering wheel with your hands," when programming it isn't necessary to direct the driver on <i>exactly</i> what to type. Instead, the navigator should be focused more on the general direction the driver takes.

			Pair programming is a big part of DBC. As I type this, I've already had several pairing sessions, all of which I feel I've benefited greatly from both technically and culturally.
			<p>There were several moments during pairing where myself or my partner finally solved a problem we were stuck on. For me, it feels incredibly rewarding when I'm able to work with a partner to finally get our code running and passing rspec tests for each challenge. The only frustrations I ever had were with connection problems here and there, but that is ultimately out of our control.</p>
			<p>At the other end of DBC's pair programming is the feedback system. At the end of each pairing session, both people go off to the feedback app to provide each other with <b>a</b>ctionable, <b>s</b>pecific, and <b>k</b>ind (ASK) feedback.
			<p>When reading my own feedback, I mostly felt relieved that my partners felt they were benefiting culturally and technically from pairing with me. Overall, it has helped assure me that I am keeping up with the curriculum.</p>
			<p>When writing feedback, I think my biggest struggle was to actually find any kind of actionable feedback to give. Overall, I feel that every person I've paired with was putting in 100% and contributing just as much to the code as I was, and any criticism would be unnecessary nitpicking.</p>
