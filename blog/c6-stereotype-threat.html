				In his <a class="hLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1fzIuuXlkk">Columbia University lecture</a>, social psychologist Claude M. Steele describes Stereotype Threat as an issue of individuals' actions and performance being influenced by their perceived risk of confirming negative stereotypes belonging to their social group. In this context, a person's social group can be anything from race, to ethnicity, political affiliation, academic institution, age group, and so on. Typically, whenever a person finds themselves as a minority in one aspect or another among a wider group that they may be in the presence of, they become more conscious of what sets them apart and what social group(s) they might represent.
				<p>This effect manifests itself in examples such as test scores, including one particular study that show lower scores by women did <b>not</b> point to women somehow biologically having lower IQs. Instead, the mere fact that they went into the test with the attitude "this test is harder for women" made them perform worse. The test, when given with the preface "don't worry about the test being hard, both genders score equally as well on it," removed the disparity between men and women's test scores. Claude M. Steele very thoroughly proves that internal and external stereotype cues can negatively influence social groups that should otherwise perform just as well as different social groups.
				<p>Overall, I found this talk very enlightening, but I struggled to personally relate to the issue of stereotype threat. As a young, white, male American, I have to acknowledge that I've <a class="hLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7FawbAJpoQ">got it pretty darn good</a>. As Louis C.K. points out, it's not right or fair that we receive better privileges (or less disadvantages) based on race and skin color, but it is the unfortunate reality of the world we live in. And this ties into a well-known phenomenon Mr. Steele mentioned: "stereotype lift." It's actually slightly advantageous to be on the upside of someone else's negative stereotype.
				<p>The very worst stereotype threat that I can identify with is that I sometimes fear if I speak my mind, people may discredit my voice by claiming I need to "<a class="hLink" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/3-ways-checking-your-privilege-never-fixed-anything/">check my privilege</a>." I have experienced hostility in discussions, even when I was outright agreeing with those telling me my opinion wasn't welcome, solely by virtue of me being a white male. Still, I find it difficult to feel <i>too</i> bad about it, it almost feels wrong to compare it and bring it into this discussion where we're also considering the issues of other social groups who are actually having to fight for their civil rights. In other words, my problem of "people are telling me to shut up on the internet!" utterly pales in comparison to gays not being able to marry, racial profiling and harsh prison sentencing of blacks, etc. etc., so if I wasn't writing this for my DBC assignment I wouldn't feel strongly enough to bring it up. And that attitude itself may or may not be a manifestation of stereotype threat.</p>
				<p>Ultimately, I support a strong egalitarian approach in some way or form as a solution to most social problems, including stereotype threat. Specifically, stereotype threat can be combated by removing emphasis on race, gender, and other potential social differences.</p>
