		<div class="gcontent">
				Continuing from last week's <a class="hLink" href="c6-stereotype-threat.html">blog post</a>, we identified Stereotype Threat as an issue of individuals' actions and performance being influenced by their perceived risk of confirming negative stereotypes belonging to their social group. In this blog post, I'll talk about my personal method to combat this problem.
				<p>As a general rule of thumb, I dislike labels and -isms for self-describing ones own stance on social, political, and religious issues. Too often do they become blow up into the mainstream and have their definitions co-opted and twisted into something different and possibly ugly. Not to mention how they play into Stereotype Threat - people are essentially dividing and dehumanizing huge segments of the population, all the while creating stereotypes for themselves and any dissenting ideologies.</p>
				<p>Take, for example, the recent #GamerGate kerfuffle. The situation is <a class="hLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy">complex, to say the least</a>. Involved in this situation are several groups of people, many of which with valid concerns and good intentions. Many are advocating for stomping out toxic attitudes towards women in the gaming community and introducing stronger female roles in games. Many want to put a spotlight on the nepotism of the games journalism industry. Others are doling out death threats, doxxing, trolling, and other harassment. (This has <a class="hLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fine_Young_Capitalists#History">happened</a> to <a class="hLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Sarkeesian#Continued_harassment_and_GamerGate">both sides</a>) And yet, a large portion of people on either side of the GamerGate label seem incapable of recognizing that the other side does have very reasonable, rational concerns. Instead of focusing on the actual issues of feminism in gaming and the lack of ethics in gaming journalism, the entire conversation has been reduced to arguing over a hashtag, and focusing on only the most extreme wrongs of people on either side of that hashtag. Pro-GamerGate? "Must be a woman-hating virgin neckbeard!"" Anti-GamerGate? "Must be a man-hating self-righteous SJW!" In the end, nothing is accomplished except for further polarizing the population.</p>
				<p>I strongly caution against focusing on labels over the actual issues. A contributer to this problem is the fact that much of the "discussion" is back-and-forth Twitter messages that are severely limited in size. This encourages people to create and digest only small, bite-sized, overly-simplified thoughts and ideas. I would urge everyone, in this situation and others, to filter out the back-and-forth 140-character banter, and try to listen and recognize each others concerns on a more deeper, honest level. Above all, avoid creating (conciously or unconciously) a <a class="hLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man">strawman</a> argument for someone before you even listen to them speak.</p>
				<p>Personally, as an egalitarian feminist and a heavy gamer myself, I hope these values help me others have more meaningful discussions. I don't want to be automatically be lumped in with those would send in death threats to popular feminist speakers when I speak out against the poor state of the gaming journalism industry. Likewise, I don't want to be lumped in with radical "SJW/Tumblirnas" when I speak out against the all-too-prevalent poor acceptance and toxic attitude against women. This is definitely a concern of mine going forward into the tech industry, for as much passion as I see on Twitter and social media, I also see a profound lack of reasonable discussion.
