				Coolness under fire - it's not a trait I would associate with any of my happiest or of satisfying moments, but I'm choosing to write about it because I think it's gotten me through a lot of tough moments in life.
				<p>My previous job was an EMT. That was a job that came with a lot of chaos. With screaming patients, screaming dispatch, and screaming desk-jockey managers, "coolness under fire" was an essential trait to survive the job. I think if I could put up with screaming psych patients trying to hit and bite me, there's really nothing in the tech world that could make me lose my cool. (Okay, I might freak a little if I was <a class="hLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0mwT3DkG4w">this guy</a> - language warning)</p>
				<p>I would strongly agree (<b>5</b>) that I try to live up to this value on a daily basis. I consciously try not to worry about things out of my control, and I recognize that things that are in my control are best handled with a cool head.</p>
				<p>Before leaving my last job, I typically had seniority when working as part of any given crew. I would often get asked about different locations that I was familiar with. I had memorized dozens of hospital access codes, parking procedures, entrance locations, etc. etc. This really ties into the value of "reputation," because I was to go-to guy when another EMT had a question. I also eager to answer those questions and spread my knowledge.</p>
				<p>I did once get told by another EMT that they were surprised as how long I had been there, because other senior EMTs typically bragged about it and acted like they knew everything. In this case, a good way to mediate the stereotype threat of senior EMTs being hard-to-work-with know-it-alls would be to continue what I've always done: offer my knowledge when asked, but don't take over other people's work when they are in the process of learning, and especially don't micro-manage people new to any given task.</p>
