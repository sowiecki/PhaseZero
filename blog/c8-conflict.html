			At this point in the curriculum, I'm asked to talk about a conflict I had at some point in my life. As I often do in these cultural blogs, I'm going to draw on my experiences as an EMT. I'm also going to take care here not to violate <a class="hLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act">HIPAA</a>.
			<p>When most people think of ambulance transports, they think back to chaotic scenes from movies and TV where a person is bleeding out and requiring extensive medical intervention. Those situations are extremely rare, and actually many ambulance transports are relatively-routine hospital transfers. For instance, if a person ends up in the emergency room of a hospital without a psychiatric ward, an ambulance would have to transport that patient to another hospital where they could be admitted to the appropriate ward. This was a large portion of the type of calls I did, I'd say at least 30%.</p>
			<p>On one particular "pysch transport," we had a man (who I will refrain from going into detail describing) who was to be transported to a psychiatric hospital for suicidal ideation and severe emotional distress. The trip was expected to take us over an hour in driving. When we arrived at the origin hospital, I noticed immediately that he was very agitated. I also noticed that the security staff assigned to monitor him were not being particularly kind. When my partner went to do the initial assessment, one security officer grabbed the patient's arm forcefully and presented it to my partner to take a blood pressure on - he didn't even ask or wait to allow the patient to do it willingly.</p>
			<p>One of my mantras throughout life is "you get what you give," and when these security officers treated our patient like a disobedient animal, he reacted like I believe any person would: by yelling and resisting and generally increasing the stress level in the room. This creates a conflict I became very familiar with during my career as an EMT: that of an uncooperative patient.</p>
			<p>My partner and I eventually transferred the patient to our cot and loaded up in the ambulance, with him driving and me monitoring the patient. The trip started, as I expected, with the patient still extremely agitated and refusing to allow me to reasssess his blood pressure. Instead of trying to force or command him to behave differently, I tried listening to his problem. I had no intention of being capable of solving all his problems in life there, of course, but I had hope that I could at least difuse the situation and bring down his current state of agitation.</p>
			<p>At first, he was insistent that he only wanted to talk to a close friend of his that was not present. I let him know I was there if he wanted to talk, but I left it at that as I did not want to push him to talk to me if he wasn't comfortable doing so. Instead, I asked him about his taste in music. He opened up about his favorite band, and calmed down a little in the process. I then looked the band up on my phone and found a few of their songs to play for the remainder of the trip. As soon as he heard the music playing, he actually broke a smile! While it certainly didn't solve all his life's problems, it did resolve his conflict with us, and it was a much better and healthier solution as opposed to other possible solutions such as soft restraining devices for combative patients.
