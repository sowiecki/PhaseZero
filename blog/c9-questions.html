		<div class="gcontent">
			<p>The most important part of asking any question is framing the problem into as short and concise of a description as possible, while also making clear how the desired solution should work.This goes for questions posed to people <i>and</i> to questions fed to online search engines.</p>
			<p>Speaking of search engines, the Internet is the single largest gathering of human knowledge, so it's no wonder that sites like <a class="hLink" href="http://lmgtfy.com/">Let Me Google That For You</a> exist to use mockingly as a response to questions that could easily be answered by spending a few seconds typing it into Google.</p>
			<p>But not all questions can be Googled, and those that can have to have <i>someone</i> be the first one to ask it before the search engine crawls over and records the answer. Also, remember that when asking someone - in person or on an online forum or message board - you should be considerate of the time and effort they'll have to put into providing the answer.</p>
			<div class="ghr"></div>
			<p>Failing all else, if you cannot find the answer to your question, another method is to propose <i>the wrong answer</i> and watch as people flock to correct you. Known as <a class="hLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#Ideas_and_inventions">Cunningham's Law</a>, it is the Internet equivalent of a French saying "pr&ecirc;cher le faux pour savoir le vrai" - "preach the falsehood to know the truth.""

			<p>While I'm linking XKCD comics, I'd also like to encourage anyone that <i>does</i> find their answer, if you first asked on an online message board, please return to provide your working solution!
