			<p>Ruby on Rails is an open source web framework. If you're reading this, you've almost certainly used sites that were built on it. GitHub and Twitter, for example, are partially built with Ruby on Rails!
			<p>To understand Ruby on Rails, you have to understand what a web framework is. A web framework exists to support developing dynamic websites and web applications by reducing the overhead required for common activities performed during web development.</p>
			<p>Think of the spirit of DRY - Do Not Repeat yourself. When creating a program in Ruby, you wouldn't want to repeat a snippet of code over and over again, so you'd create a class for it and use instances of that class throughout your program. Web frameworks in general, and Ruby on Rails especially embrace a similar concept by using libraries to handle commonly performed actions like database access and session management, just to list two examples. By not reinventing the wheel every time a developer sits down to start a new website or web application, development time is drastically reduced and products can be delivered much more quickly. This is the reason Ruby on Rails is so popular among everyone from small startups to large businesses.</p>
			<p>Ruby on Rails uses the "Model-view-controller" (MVC) pattern for implementation of user interfaces. In this pattern, the <b>user</b> <i>uses</i> the <b>controller</b>, the controller <i>manipulates</i> the <b>model</b>, the model <i>updates</i> the <b>view</b>, which is then fed back for the user to see.
